*human.txt* Collection of vim default options for humans.

To use this plugin you just have to install it, and you will start to notice
small changes in Vim that will make more sense. If you need to change the
value of an option contained in this plugin, you must do so after loading the
plugin in your `VIMRC` file or in a separate file in the `after/plugin/`
folder, if you do it before, your options will be rewritten.

1. Mappings                                                  *human-mappings*

Vim for Humans creates key mappings to navigate between buffers, following
the same Vim philosophy for navigating between tabs.

The "smart" mappings are:

1.1. Normal mode

- Use `gB` for previous buffer.
- Use `gb` for next buffer.

1.2. Insert and visual mode

- Use `Shift + Page Down` for previous buffer.
- Use `Shift + Page Up` for next buffer.

2. Plugins                                                    *human-plugins*

It also includes two minimalistic and modernized plugins with on-demand
functions to further enhance the human experience. It seems that these
plugins are no longer maintained by their author, so I've included them here.

The plugins included are:

2.1. Maximizer

Maximizer lets you maximize split windows and restore them automatically.
It is very useful if you like to have many split windows per tab.

Maximizer has only one command:

`:MaximizerToggle`

When the current window is not in maximized state, Maximizer saves dimensions
and positions of all windows in the current tab, and then it performs
maximization of the active window. The second time the command is invoked,
Maximizer restores all windows to the previously saved positions.

Enabled by default, but you can disable it by initializing the following
variable before loading Vim for Humans. For example:

`let g:loaded_maximizer = 0`

2.2. Numbers

Numbers is a plugin for intelligently toggling line numbers.

This plugin alternates between relative numbering ( |relativenumber| ) and
absolute numbering ( |number| ) for the active window depending on the mode
you are in. In a GUI, it also functions based on whether or not has focus.

Enabled by default, but you can disable it by initializing the following
variable before loading Vim for Humans. For example:

`let g:loaded_numbers = 0`

If you see numbers where they don't belong like in the Vim |help| menus or
other plugins, be sure to add the **FileTypes** or **BufTypes** used by your
plugins to the excludes list. The default values for excluded types are:

`" Numbers for Humans exclude filetypes.`
`let g:numbers_exclude_filetypes = [ 'nerdtree', 'netrw', 'startify' ]`

`" Numbers for Humans exclude buftypes.`
`let g:numbers_exclude_buftypes = [ 'help', 'nofile', 'quickfix' ]`
