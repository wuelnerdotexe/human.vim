All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.1.1] - 2022-07-18

### Fixed

- The [numbers.vim](https://github.com/myusuf3/numbers.vim) plugin is removed because there is already an easier way to implement it. Why didn't I realize it before? If you want to get that feature back, install the [vim-numbertoggle](https://github.com/jeffkreeftmeijer/vim-numbertoggle) plugin.

## [1.1.0] - 2022-07-18

### Added

- **Dark mode** is on by default because **humans hate light backgrounds**.
- **Minimalistic** and **modernized** versions of the [numbers.vim](https://github.com/myusuf3/numbers.vim) and [vim-maximized](https://github.com/szw/vim-maximizer) plugins are added.

## [1.0.0] - 2022-07-16

- Initial release
